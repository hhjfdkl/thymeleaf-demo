# Thymeleaf demo

- Thymeleaf is a very useful template processor for Spring Boot.
- You can make templates for various document types (HTML, XML, Text, JavaScript, CSS, plaintext) and have Thymeleaf populate those templates based on your code.
- Templates are stored in the `resources/templates` directory

If you're expecting a consistent form for your document, Thymeleaf will be able to fill it out for you
